### install_vulnerable_windows.ps1
PowerShell Script for Windows: Install Vulnerable Software for Purple Team Lab
This script installs and configures vulnerable software on Windows (Server 2016+ or 10+). It includes:

Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) setup as a vulnerable domain.
BadBlood (introduces thousands of vulnerable objects, users, groups, permissions; exploitable via Metasploit AD modules like auxiliary/gather/ldap_query or Kerberoasting exploits).
DVWA via XAMPP (intentionally vulnerable web app, as above).
Vulnerable IIS/FTP (old config, exploitable via Metasploit's IIS/FTP modules like exploit/windows/iis/iis_webdav_scstoragepathfromurl).

Run as Administrator (e.g., powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File install_vulnerable_windows.ps1). Assumes a fresh install; test in a VM. Derived from tested GitHub and lab sources.
