üõë Disable antivirus temporarily, as many of these apps are flagged due to their vulnerability.

‚úÖ Run the apps as administrator to allow listening on required ports.

üß∞ Optional Automation with PowerShell Script
You can create a script like:

powershell
Copy
Edit
# PowerShell Example (Run as Admin)
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://example.com/FreeFloatFTP.exe" -OutFile "C:\Tools\FreeFloatFTP.exe"
Start-Process "C:\Tools\FreeFloatFTP.exe"
Repeat for each app. You can even schedule them to run at startup for persistent lab VMs.
